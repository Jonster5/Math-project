            After examining this slogan in all of its forms, I have concluded that it is not a very realistic slogan. Even though it is not a very realistic, it is appealing and quite catchy.
            <br /><br /> Even though the slogan is very dishonest, I do not mind it that much and I will still buy from Amazon whenever I feel like it.
